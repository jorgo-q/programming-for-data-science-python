# Python Projects for Data Science

A collection of Python projects and exercises exploring key concepts in data science, algorithms, and software design.  
Each project builds on real-world problem-solving, from simulations and visualizations to predictive modeling with Markov chains.

## What's Inside
- **Data Analysis & Visualization** — working with `matplotlib`, probability models, and datasets.  
- **Predictive Modeling** — implementing algorithms like Markov Chains to forecast outcomes.  
- **Core Python Concepts** — lists, loops, functions, conditionals, and object-oriented programming.  

## Goal
To strengthen my Python foundations through practical projects and progressively apply them to data-driven and product-focused problems.
